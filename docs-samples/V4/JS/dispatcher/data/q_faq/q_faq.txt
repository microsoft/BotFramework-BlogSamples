Question
My Contoso smart light won't turn on.
Light won't turn on.
My smart light app stopped responding.
How do I contact support?
I need help.
I upgraded the app and it doesn't work anymore.
Light doesn't work after upgrade.
Who should I contact for customer service?
Why does the light not work?
How long does the light's battery last for?
What type of light bulb do I need?
